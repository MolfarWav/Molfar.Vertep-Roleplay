# Changelog (Molfar Vertep fork)

Changes on top of upstream Roleplay 4.18.2 (`b509845`).

## 4.20.0

- New look, **Vertep**: a built-in dark theme (oxblood red accent, cyan primary buttons) and the default on a fresh install. An existing install keeps its chosen theme; Vertep appears first in Settings → Themes. Themes take an optional `cta` colour for primary buttons (missing = the accent). A fresh install also follows the theme's quote colour instead of a fixed green.
- Kurale is the heading font: page titles, navigation labels, chips.
- The navigation rail shows labels from 1280 px, in groups split by an ornament (Home, Chats · Characters, Marketplace, Personas, Lorebooks · Presets, Connections · Shortcuts, Tools · Settings at the bottom); narrower windows keep the icon rail with tooltips.
- Sections open as full pages with a large title and a count, from Home, Chats or another section. Over an open chat they still slide in as a drawer, so the chat and a running reply stay put.
- Navigation and page titles in Ukrainian: Settings → Interface language (follows the browser by default).

## 4.19.2

- The summary prompt ships with the plugin and follows its updates, like Litopys's: Settings keep one only when you changed it, **Reset** clears your copy, and a copy that is an earlier default word for word follows the new one. Settings read the default from the engine (`GET /settings/summary-prompt`) instead of carrying their own copy.
- Prompts that make a model write for you say which language to write in: the summary and the facts the chat memory finds follow the language of the story. The image-prompt writer says it writes English whatever the story's language, because image models expect English.
- `test/rp-prompts.test.ts`: every shipped prompt is English, and the ones that write for the user carry a language line.

## 4.19.1

- Litopys prompts ship with the plugin and follow its updates: `config.json` keeps a prompt only when you changed it, and the panel shows **Restore default prompts** when you did. A config holding an earlier default word for word follows the new one.
- New scribe and curator prompts: facts in the story's own language, a character's claim kept as theirs (not as world truth), one-scene details (mood, weather, time of day) left out, at most 8 new facts per pass, no restating what the record already says; the curator returns ops only for items that need one and never retires a fact for age alone.

## 4.19.0

- Litopys (formerly Archivarius) ships with the app: a world-lore keeper that
  extracts world facts, a chronicle and a running recap from each chat into
  `data/litopys/store.json` and `data/vault-chats/<character>.md`, and a
  curator that proposes clean-ups for approval. It reads `data/archivarius/*`
  until its first save, and an Archivarius copy left in `plugins/` stops running
  (`"replaces": ["archivarius"]`; needs Molfar Vertep 0.2.0 or newer).
- Chat memory recall matches Ukrainian and Russian word forms: stems, stop
  words, the typographic apostrophe, rarer words weigh more. Before, only
  lowercase Latin words of 4+ letters could match, so Cyrillic memories never
  surfaced by text. Duplicate detection keeps Cyrillic letters too.
- Plugin panels: `select` and `model` field kinds (the model picker groups by
  endpoint), hints, placeholders, row counts and an Advanced section.
- Settings: the memory model uses the same searchable model picker.
- Themes: optional per-level heading colors, the Neon Tokyo Night theme and
  two neon heading CSS snippets.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: a detailed file map for agents editing the app.
- App skills in `.skills/`: `edit-large-card`, `roleplay-ui-orchestrator`.
